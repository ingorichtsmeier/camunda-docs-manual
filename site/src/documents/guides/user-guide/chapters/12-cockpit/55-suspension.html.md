In the Process Definition View and in the Process Instance View you have the option of suspending the selected process definition or the process instance that you are viewing by using the <button class="btn btn-xs dropdown-toggle"><img src="ref:asset:/assets/img/implementation-cockpit/suspended.png"/></button> button on the right hand side. 

## Process definition suspension

If you suspend the process definition, you can prevent the process definition from being instantiated. No further operations can be done while the process definition is in the suspended state. You can simply re-activate the process definition by using the <button class="btn btn-xs dropdown-toggle"><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-play"></i> </button> button on the right hand side. You also have the option of suspending/reactivating all process instances of the process definition as well as defining if the process definition (and process instances) should instantly be suspended/reactivated or at a specific time in a confirmation dialog. You can find more information about the functionality of this in the <a href="ref:#process-engine-process-engine-concepts-suspending-process-definitions">Suspending process definitions</a> section of the Process Engine chapter.


## Process instance suspension

If you suspend the process instance, you can prevent the process instance from being executed any further. This includes suspending all tasks included in the process instance. You can simply re-activate the process instance by using the <button class="btn btn-xs dropdown-toggle"><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-play"></i> </button> button on the right hand side. You can find more information about the functionality of this in the <a href="ref:#process-engine-process-engine-concepts-suspending-process-instances">Suspending process instances</a> section of the Process Engine chapter.


## Job definition suspension

In the Process Definition View you have the option of suspending a job definition. This can be done by using the <button class="btn btn-xs dropdown-toggle"><img src="ref:asset:/assets\img\implementation-cockpit\suspended.png"/></button> button displayed in the Action column of the Job Definitions tab at the bottom of the screen. By doing this, you can prevent this job definition from being processed in all process instances of the selected process definition. You can simply re-activate the job definition by using the <button class="btn btn-xs dropdown-toggle"><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-play"></i> </button> button in the same Action column. You can find more information about the functionality of this in the <a href="ref:#process-engine-process-engine-concepts-suspending-and-activating-job-execution">Suspending and activating job execution</a> section of the Process Engine chapter.

Underneath that section, the embedded form is displayed (please note that external task forms cannot be displayed here), you can switch to the task history, you can see the diagram view or you can view the description of the user task.

  </div>
  <div class="col-xs-6 col-sm-6 col-md-9">
    <p>
      To start a process instance via Tasklist, hit the <button class="btn btn-xs"><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-list-alt"></i></button> button and select a process out of the displayed list of process definitions. If no process definitions are listed here, please verify that your process application is deployed correctly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Depending on whether you have defined a <a href="ref:#task-forms">start form</a> for your process it will be displayed now. Otherwise you get a notification that no form has been defined for starting the process. In this case, a <a href="ref:#task-forms-generic-task-forms">generic</a> start form will be displayed and Tasklist will offer the option of adding variables to the process instance.

    <p>
      Here you can see an overview of all tasks for the selected <a href="ref:#tasklist-filters">filter</a>. By default the filter with the lowest priority is displayed first. After selecting the appropriate filter, you will see an overview of all tasks, sorted by a specified criteria (by default <i>Priority</i>). You can change the sorting of the tasks by clicking on <i>Sort by Priority</i> and selecting one of the options <i>Created (sort by time and date of creation)</i>, <i>Due date</i>, <i>Follow-up date</i>, <i>Task name</i> or <i>Assignee</i>. You can toggle between ascending and descending order by clicking on the arrow (<button class="btn btn-xs"><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-up"></i></button>, respectively <button class="btn btn-xs"><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-down"></i></button>).

### Search for Tasks by variable

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-xs-6 col-sm-6 col-md-3">
    <img data-img-thumb src="ref:asset:/assets/img/implementation-tasklist/tasklist-variable-filter.png" />
  </div>
  <div class="col-xs-6 col-sm-6 col-md-9">
    <p>
      Above the filter results, you have the option of searching for user tasks by variable within the selected filter results. To do so, click in the search box and select which variables to search for, either a Process Variable, a Task Variable or a Case Variable. Next you need to insert both a Property and a Value for the variable. By default the operator is _equal to_ (=). You can toggle the operator and select _not equal to_ (!=), _greater than_ (>), _lower than_ (<), _equal to or greater than_ (>=) or _equal to or lower than_ (<=). Depending on the data type of your search, the operators can vary slightly. If you change the filter selection, the search will be performed on the selected filter and the results will be updated accordingly.

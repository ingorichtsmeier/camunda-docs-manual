We use Atlassian [JIRA](https://app.camunda.com/jira) as an issue tracking system to organize our daily work. In JIRA, we organize our issues in two different projects, one is for enterprise customer support and one for the development of the Camunda BPM platform. Log in with your support account to create [support tickets](ref:#jira-issue-tracker-support-project) (i.e., labeled as `SUPPORT-1234`) or [Camunda BPM project tickets](ref:#jira-issue-tracker-camunda-bpm-project) (i.e., labeled as `CAM-5678`). In the following section you find an introduction to both projects.
